# Organization of the repository

The folder “Anonymized images” contains a total of 225 SGUS images, acquired from the four clinical centers in Europe:
- Rheumatology Clinic, Department of Medical Area, University of Udine, Academic Hospital S. Maria della Misericordia, Udine, Italy (Alen Zabotti, Sara Zandonella, Salvatore De Vita)
- Department of Rheumatology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia (Alojzija Hocevar)
- Institute of Rheumatology, Belgrade, Serbia (Vera Milic)
- Unit of Clinical Rheumatology, Department of Rheumatology and Medical Sciences, ASST Centro Traumatologico Ortopedico G. Pini-CTO, Milan, Italy (Orazio De Lucia)

Furthermore, we provide an accompanying excel file “Data info.xls” with the corresponding information about provided images, including:
- gland type (parotid/submandibular), 
- ultrasonography device brand (GE-Belgrade, Philips-Ljubljana, Esaote-Milano, Samsung-Udine), 
- definite pSS (primary Sjogren’s syndrome) scores (De Vita, and OMERACT),
- patients’ information.

# Purpose of the repository and the HarmonicSS initiative

HarmonicSS is EU Commission-funded (http://harmonicss.eu) initiative, which gather the leading pSS experts (35 partners from 13 countries) with the aim to envelop independently reported cohorts and metacentric data. At the current stage of the initiative, this data set was used to: i) compare the reliability performance between of two semi-quantitative SGUS scores (i.e., De Vita et al. and OMERACT score); ii) evaluate the reliability among sonographers with a different levels of expertise in SGUS, and knowledge of the two scores tested in the study; iii) provide a data set that will be publically available to serve as a standardized benchmark for further studies on SGUS. Thus, the principal idea with this public data set is to increase transparency and reproducibility on the topic of pSS in SGUS.

# Referent performances obtained in the proposing study

In the study associated with this repository, we used kappa statistics to measure intra and inter-reader reliability performances of 20 sonographers – while considering four groups of observers with respect to their experience. Sonographers with at least six years of experience in SGUS were identified as experts, while users were the ones already applied De Vita et al. and/or OMERACT scores in clinical practice or for research purposes. Four different levels of sonographers were identified as follows: user and experts (U-E group), non-users and experts (NU-E group), users and non-experts (U-NE), non-users and non-experts (NU-NE group).  
  
The intra-rater reliability for both scores was excellent, with a Light’s kappa of 0.86 for the De Vita et al. score and 0.87 for the OMERACT score. The inter-rater reliability for De Vita et al. and OMERACT score was good with Light’s Kappa of 0.75 for the former and 0.77 for the latter. Among sonographers with different levels of experience and use of SGUS scores the exercise did not reveal significant differences among groups. The intra-rater reliability was excellent, while the inter-rater reliability was good in all groups. 

The rest of details, including description of data acquisition, scorings etc. are available in the associated publication.
